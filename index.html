    <h1>Welcome to "The Fastest Website in the West"</h1>
    <p>
      Feast your eyes on the fastest website in this corner of the internet!
    </p>

    <h2>Here's how we're so fast</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most modern websites, we use a proprietary JavaScript framework that has a footprint of
      <span class="holy-cow">0 Bytes</span>! And that's before minifying and gzipping our application bundle!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Some other awesome facts</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Your Question</th>
          <th>Our Answer</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>WAI-ARIA Compliance?</td>
          <td>You bet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HIPPA Compliance?</td>
          <td>My favorite animal.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SEO???</td>
          <td>Okay, at least be reasonable...</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>But that's not all...</h2>
    <p>
      You must be thinking, "wow, with all that performance, there's no way this site could have an unordered list with three items and an image hosted on the same domain..."
    </p>
    <p>
      Think again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="cat.jpeg" alt="First cat"></li>
      <li><img src="cat.jpeg" alt="Second cat"></li>
      <li><img src="cat.jpeg" alt="Third cat"></li>
    </ul>
